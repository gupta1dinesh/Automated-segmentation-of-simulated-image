# Automated-segmentation-of-simulated-image
applying random forest classifiers and Gabor filters

Automated segmentation of simulated image was created to well define the edge detection of an object in
the artificially created images. The methods used are Gabor filter, random forest classifiers , Edge canny detection, gaussian filter, median filter.
So, the equation of Gabor filter is as follow

Gabor filter is a linear filter applied for surface texture detection. It is used to examine distributed frequency in specific region of image 
based on Gaussian filter with sigma 3 and 7.



Result: The result showed a successful segmentation of simulated images

{Note: It's recommended to alter different values of gabor filters parameter in order to optimize the precise edge segmentation of your images}
