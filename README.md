# Automated-segmentation-of-simulated-image
applying random forest classifiers and Gabor filters

Automated segmentation of simulated image was created to well define the edge detection of an object in
the artificially created images. The equation of Gabor filter is as follow

Gabor filter is a linear filter applied for surface texture detection. It is used to examine distributed frequency in specific region of image based 
based on Gaussian filter with sigma 3 and 7.
